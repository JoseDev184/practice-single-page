# practice-single-page
In this project Im working (1 how to install and use sass)
today I connect succefully sass to my HTML project and connect multiple @import 

@import is the way to connent on code to another 
@extend really cool part with sass is that I can do something like this 

%aling-center {
text-decoration:none;
color: $blue;
margin: 0px;

I can pass this line of code  just adding 
@extend

I can put of my color in a code page and using just adding $gold
but I have to name its in a separare page 

 colors.scss 
 $blue: color propeties
 $white: color propeties
 $red: color propeties
 $black: color propeties

 I can use this colos like this 

 &__menu{
 backgroung-color: $red
 

end of this project, I started to refresh my memorie about coding HTML CSS and introducing some ideas consent of SASS,
I going to keep practice and anpthers project with the same tegnologies above and adding BOOSTRAPS!
